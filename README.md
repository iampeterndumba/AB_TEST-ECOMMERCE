# AB_TEST-ECOMMERCE

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. For this project, we will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website or a company.As a data analyst, my goal for this project is to help the company decide if they should:

   #### Implement the new webpage,
   ### Keep the old webpage, or
    ###Perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
